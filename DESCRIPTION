Description: Survival analysis models are commonly used in medicine and other areas. Many of them
    are too complex to be interpreted by human. Exploration and explanation is needed, but
    standard methods do not give a broad enough picture. survex provides easy-to-apply
    methods for explaining survival models, both complex blackboxes and simpler statistical models.

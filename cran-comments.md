## Resubmission  05/09/2023 v.1.1.3

* Fix notes about long running examples by wrapping
  in \donttest{} blocks.
* Fix notes about CPU time being much longer than elapsed
  time when running tests and building vignettes.
  
## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* Found possibly invalid URLs -- the URLs were
  checked to be valid and working, seems to be
  a false positive


## Reverse dependencies

* `survex` does not have any reverse dependencies

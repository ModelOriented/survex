\title{Calculate integrated Brier score}
\usage{
integrated_brier_score(y_true = NULL, risk = NULL, surv = NULL, times = NULL)

loss_integrated_brier_score(
  y_true = NULL,
  risk = NULL,
  surv = NULL,
  times = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_true}{a \code{survival::Surv} object containing the times and statuses of observations for which the metric will be evaluated}

\item{risk}{ignored, left for compatibility with other metrics}

\item{surv}{a matrix containing the predicted survival functions for the considered observations, each row represents a single observation, whereas each column one time point}

\item{times}{a vector of time points at which the survival function was evaluated}
}
\value{
numeric from 0 to 1, lower values indicate better performance
}
\description{
This function calculates the integrated Brier score metric for a survival model.
}
\details{
It is useful to see how a model performs as a whole, not at specific time points, for example for easier comparison. This function allows for calculating the integral of Brier score metric numerically using the trapezoid method.

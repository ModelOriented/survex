\title{Calculate Cumulative/Dynamic AUC}
\usage{
cd_auc(y_true = NULL, risk = NULL, surv = NULL, times = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_true}{a \code{survival::Surv} object containing the times and statuses of observations for which the metric will be evaluated}

\item{risk}{ignored, left for compatibility with other metrics}

\item{surv}{a matrix containing the predicted survival functions for the considered observations, each row represents a single observation, whereas each column one time point}

\item{times}{a vector of time points at which the survival function was evaluated}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of length equal to the length of the times vector, each value (from the range from 0 to 1) represents the AUC metric at a specific time point, with higher values indicating better performance.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Cumulative/Dynamic AUC metric for a survival model. It is done using the
estimator proposed proposed by Uno et al. [1],
and Hung and Chang [2].
}
\details{
C/D AUC is an extension of the AUC metric known from classification models.
Its values represent the model's performance at specific time points.
It can be integrated over the considered time range.
